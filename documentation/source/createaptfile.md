# Create an Aptfile

This utility allows you to create Aptfiles by providing basic information about your app
and dependencies.

```{important}
The Aptfile is generated by an algorithm to create Aptfiles.

This algorithm tries it's best to follow the Aptfile specifications. However this
algorithm doesn't always generate Aptfiles as a human would write them.
**It might not follow your dependencies, or it might not work at all.**

If your Aptfile fails to be parsed by the installer then please
[report an issue](https://github.com/TylerMS887/Aptfile/issues/new/choose).
```

```{py-script}
:file: createui.py
```

Provide information about this app, then check "Review" to see your Aptfile.

**Dependencies**

Your dependencies can be from OS repositories or the [Aptfile repository](https://github.com/TylerMS887/aptfile-repo).

**Recommended Packages**

`aptfile` will provide information about these packages before installation and ask if the user wants to install them.

**Suggested Packages**

`aptfile` will provide information about these packages before installation but will not ask if the user wants to install them.
```
```{tab} Review
This Aptfile contains all your application information, and even dependencies.

**The algorithm can make corrupted Aptfiles, so please carefully review the Aptfile and validate it with a TOML validator.**
