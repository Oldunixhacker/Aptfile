# This is designed to be read by appstores. Without it, you should NOT list your app on Linux
# app stores, and you should NOT recommend your app to non-developers. It's called "humanfriendly"

[apt.dependencies]
# dependencies is freeform. Any package can go in as a value. You can define just the major number,
# the major and minor number, or even all 3 numbers (major, minor, and patch). It is recommended to
# use the major and minor number. This example demonstrates requiring Python 3.9 or newer to run the
# program, including Cython. Written in pip format or "latest".
